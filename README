1. Introduction

   SendIP is a tool to send completely arbitrary packets out over the network.
   In conjunction with PackPrint (see
   http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/packprint.html), this makes an
   extremely powerful debugging tool for networks.

1.1 Home page

   All the latest news, documentation and versions of SendIP will be made
   available from http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/ or directly from the
   the author.

2. Protocols

   Here is a list of protocols that SendIP currently understands:
   * IPv4
   *   TCP
   *     BGP
   *   ICMP
   *   UDP
   *     RIP
   * IPv6
   *   ICMPv6

   Other protocols will be added in future versions, as and when I have time
   to add them.

   Of course, it is still possible to send packets using other protocols, but
   you have to construct the packet data and headers entirely by hand.

3. Usage instructions

   SendIP can take a huge number of commandline parameters.  For this reason,
   future versions may have some sort of user interface...

	Please read the man page or sendip -h for details.  They are not documented
	here because they change often between versions and I can't be bothered to
	keep this up to date.

4. Installation

   make ; make install should work.  You may need gcc to compile it.
   If  you can't persuade it to compile or install, mail me with details of
   what goes wrong, and what system you are trying to install it on.
   You can change where it installs by changing BINDIR and/or PREFIX at the
   top of the Makefile.
	A .spec file is included to build RPMS, and source and binary RPMS are
	also available from the web page.  Debian packages are also available, and
	sendip is included in the FreeBSD ports collection.

5. Problems, Bugs, and Comments

   If you have any comments, suggestions, or bug reports, please email me.

   The email address I currently use is mike@earth.li

   I am interested in any feedback in order to improve SendIP.
